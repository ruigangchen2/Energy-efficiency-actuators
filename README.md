# Energy-efficiency-actuators
This repository stores the supplementary materials for the Energy Efficiency Actuator by Energy Recycling and Passive Dynamics

## Movie S1.
The proposed actuator concept video explains the background, idea, and the entire
working process, showing the prototype and mainly demonstrating how the
proposed actuator recycles energy and utilizes passive dynamics.
